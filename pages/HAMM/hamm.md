### Instructions
Given two strings s and t of equal length, the Hamming distance between s and t, denoted dH(s,t), is the number of corresponding symbols that differ in s and t.

:red[**Given**]: Two DNA strings s and t of equal length (not exceeding 1 kbp).

:red[**Return**]: The Hamming distance dH(s,t).
