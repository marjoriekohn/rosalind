# Counting DNA Nucleotides

### Instructions
A string is simply an ordered collection of symbols selected from some alphabet and formed into a word; the length of a string is the number of symbols that it contains. An example of a length 21 DNA string (whose alphabet contains the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T') is "ATGCTTCAGAAAGGTCTTACG."

:red[**Given**]: A DNA string `dna_string` of length at most 1000 nt.

:red[**Return**]: Four integers (separated by spaces) counting the respective number of times that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in `dna_string`.
